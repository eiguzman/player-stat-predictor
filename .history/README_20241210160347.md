# NBA Point per game predictor

## 1. Introduction
Our project is a supervised learning model capable of being a good predictor of the points per game stat based on other stats tracked by the NBA. Our final regression model, a polynomial regression model, looks at the following stats TRB_per_game, AST_per_game, MP_per_game, FGA_per_game, 3PA_per_game, 2PA_per_game, FTA_per_game, WS, BPM, PER, VORP, OBPM, and OWS from almost 24000 NBA player seasons to determine the final PPG.

Being able to predict PPG based these features is useful in generalizing early season shooting slumps 
with the other less variable stats to robustly predict a player's overall trajectory for their season ppg. 

Real world application can include predicting outcomes for betting and being able to use the stats for mvp status.
